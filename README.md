## Build from sources

It is possible also to build and run project by hand without usage of Docker.
We suggest using virtualenv for backend python server:

### Creating virtual environment
``` sh
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

### Install requirements
``` sh
python -m pip install -r backend/requirements.prod --upgrade
```

### Run server
``` sh
cd backend
python server.py
```

In another terminal, starting from root folder of the project:

### Build frontend
``` sh
cd uiow2t-front
yarn
```

### Run frontend
``` sh
yarn start
```
